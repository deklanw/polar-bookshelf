                        This release concentrated on a number of smaller
                        features requested by users plus fit and finish. The
                        major changes include refactoring the text editor so
                        that it's more clear that it supports rich text and
                        formatted HTML. We also now support cloze deletions for
                        Anki which was a big feature for a lot of users but
                        required a big refactor. Additionally we have a new logs
                        view so that you can monitor the internal behavior of
                        Polar during sync (and other) operations. You can also
                        copy the entire log to the clipboard for reporting bugs
                        to the Polar developers.

                            Polar 1.1 - Chrome Extension Support!
                        </h1>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Polar 1.1 is fresh out the door and a lot of amazing
                        features and bug fixes are enabled in this release.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The biggest feature by far is our support for the{' '}
                        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-polar/jkfdkjomocoaljglgddnmhcbolldcafd">
                            'Save to Polar' chrome extension
                        </a>{' '}
                        that allows you to send the URL of your active tab to
                        Polar for content capture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This makes it a lot easier to work with Polar as you can
                        just click a button in Chrome and have it sent to Polar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We plan on adding support for Safari, and Firefox in the
                        future but we're taking things one step at a time.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Other features in 1.1 include:</h3>

                    <li>
                        Disabling amp for now until we have a better solution on
                        how to show the user that an AMP page is displayed and
                        how to disable / enable it. Otherwise its confusing and
                        often the amp page is WORSE not better.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed bugs with the browser size not changing during
                        capture browser changing and also fixed some issues with
                        it not properly accepting the browser change in some
                        situations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed bug in HTML zoom where the page would be truncated
                        improperly.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Blocked amp ads during the capture but they aren't
                        blocked during the preview at the moment.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        "Fixed" nasty anti-aliasing bug in electron by blocking
                        amp ads. They were annoying anyway but for some reason
                        they were breaking chrome rendering - probably due to
                        some web component nonsense.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Implemented a new strategy with the vertical height
                        algorithm in the capture system to revert it back to
                        auto instead of a fixed max-height. Works a lot better
                        now.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Date/times no longer include ' ago' to be a bit more
                        concise.
                    </li>

                    <li>Added small FAQ entry to enable Anki sync.</li>

                    <li>
                        Fixed a bug where we could select text and not properly
                        work with elements.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Renderer analytics didn't understand that a callback
                        without an error wasn't a failure.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Upgraded a number of important react packages: react
                        react-dom react-moment react-select @types/react-table
                        @types/react-select @types/react @types/prop-types
                        @types/node-fetch
                    </li>

                    <li>removed inversify package (were not using it)</li>

                    <li>latest fontawesome</li>

                    <li>latest node-fetch</li>

                    <li>
                        fixed issue with electron-builder where it was forcing
                        us to upgrade to the latest version for each release.
